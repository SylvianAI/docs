Forms API uses standard HTTP status codes plus JSON error payloads for most failures.

## Common status codes

- `200 OK`: synchronous read success
- `202 Accepted`: async job accepted
- `400 Bad Request`: request shape is valid but business constraints failed
- `401 Unauthorized`: missing or invalid auth
- `402 Payment Required`: insufficient credits
- `404 Not Found`: job, file, or token not found
- `410 Gone`: download token expired
- `422 Unprocessable Entity`: validation error from request parsing
- `500 Internal Server Error`: unexpected failure
- `503 Service Unavailable`: required storage/service not available

## Error body patterns

You will commonly see one of these shapes:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Job not found",
  "job_id": "..."
}
```

```json
{
  "detail": "Missing or invalid authentication. Provide X-API-Key header."
}
```

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "insufficient_credits",
  "feature": "parse",
  "required": 12,
  "balance": 3
}
```

## Validation errors

`422` responses use FastAPI validation format and include `detail` with field-level issues (missing form fields, wrong types, etc.).
