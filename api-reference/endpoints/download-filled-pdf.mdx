Use this endpoint to download a completed PDF from a tokenized URL.

## Authentication model

This route is token-protected and does not require API-key headers.

Access is controlled by:

- token existence
- token expiration

Download links expire after **24 hours** from creation.

## Response behavior

- `200` returns binary PDF content
- `Content-Disposition` is set for attachment download
- cache-control headers disable client caching

## Common failure modes

- `404` token does not exist
- `410` token exists but is expired
- `500` storage download failure

## Example

```bash
curl "https://api.sylvian.ai/download/<token>" --output filled.pdf
```

## Python example

```python
import requests

BASE_URL = "https://api.sylvian.ai"
TOKEN = "<download-token>"

response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/download/{TOKEN}", timeout=60)
response.raise_for_status()

with open("filled.pdf", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```
