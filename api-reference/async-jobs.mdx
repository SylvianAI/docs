`/parse` and `/fill` are asynchronous endpoints.

When you submit work, the API returns `202 Accepted` with a `job_id`. You then poll a status endpoint until completion.

## Parse flow

1. `POST /parse` returns `{ job_id, file_id }`
2. Poll `GET /parse/{job_id}`
3. On success, use `file_id` as input to `/fill`

## Fill flow

1. `POST /fill` returns `{ job_id, fill_id }`
2. Poll `GET /fill/{job_id}`
3. On success, read `download_url` and fetch the PDF

## Job status values

- `queued`: accepted and waiting for worker capacity
- `running`: worker claimed the job and processing started
- `succeeded`: result is ready
- `failed`: terminal error; inspect `error` field

## Polling recommendations

- Poll every 2-5 seconds.
- Stop polling when `status` is `succeeded` or `failed`.
- Apply a timeout in your client to avoid infinite retries.
